It is used to create fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications\n​\n\n## Features of React\n\n1. **Reusable Components:** A single React app consists of many components each component have their own logic and code  but we can easily reuse components any number of time hence reducing the developers time and increasing the efficiency of work\n​\n2. **Debugging:** React app can be easily debug using  “react developer tools”.It’s a browser extension that can be used for both chrome as well as Firefox.\n​\n\n> **ReactJS**\n> Meta\n\n## Installation Reactjs on Windows\n\n## Step 1: Install Node.js\n\n- Install Node.js installer for Windows by clicking on [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n- Install the LTS version (the one present on the left). Once downloaded, open Node.js installer and click on the \"Next\" button until it’s completely installed.\n- Install the 14.18.1 LTS version.\n\n## Step 2: Verify Node.js Installation\n\n- Open the command prompt to check whether Node.js is completely installed or not by typing the command:\n\n```javascript\nnode -v\n```\n\n- If the installation went well it will give you the version you have installed\n\n## Step 3: Install create-react-app\n\n- In the terminal, run the following command to install create-react-app globally:\n\n```javascript\nnpm install -g create-react-app\n```\n\n- It will globally install react app for you. To check everything  went well run the command\n\n```javascript\ncreate-react-app --version\n```\n\n- If everything went well it will give you the installed version of react app\n\n## Step 4: Create a New Folder\n\n- Create a new folder where you want to make your React app using the command:\n\n```javascript\nmkdir newfolder\n```\n\n## Step 5: Now inside this folder run the command\n\n```javascript\ncreate-react-app reactfirst YOUR_APP_NAME\n```\n\n- It will take some time to install the required dependencies\n\n**Note:** Due to npm naming restrictions, app names can no longer contain capital letters. Therefore, please type your app's name in lowercase.\n\n## Step 6: To start your app run the below command\n\n- Once you run the above command a new tab will open in your browser showing React logo as shown below :\n\n![React Image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015204506/img78.jpg)\n\nCongratulation you have successfully installed the react-app and are ready to build awesome websites and app\n","id":1}]
