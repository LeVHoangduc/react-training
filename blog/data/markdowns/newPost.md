## Installation Reactjs on Windows

## Step 1: Install Node.js

- Install Node.js installer for Windows by clicking on [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install the LTS version (the one present on the left). Once downloaded, open Node.js installer and click on the "Next" button until it’s completely installed.
- Install the 14.18.1 LTS version.

## Step 2: Verify Node.js Installation

- Open the command prompt to check whether Node.js is completely installed or not by typing the command:

```javascript
node -v
```

- If the installation went well it will give you the version you have installed  

## Step 3: Install create-react-app

- In the terminal, run the following command to install create-react-app globally:

```javascript
npm install -g create-react-app  
```

- It will globally install react app for you. To check everything  went well run the command  

```javascript
create-react-app --version
```

- If everything went well it will give you the installed version of react app

## Step 4: Create a New Folder

- Create a new folder where you want to make your React app using the command:

```javascript
mkdir newfolder
```

## Step 5: Now inside this folder run the command

```javascript
create-react-app reactfirst YOUR_APP_NAME
```

- It will take some time to install the required dependencies

**Note:** Due to npm naming restrictions, app names can no longer contain capital letters. Therefore, please type your app's name in lowercase.

## Step 6: To start your app run the below command

- Once you run the above command a new tab will open in your browser showing React logo as shown below :
